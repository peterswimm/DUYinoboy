### **Risk-Adjusted Value Proposition**

**High-Confidence Value: $1.43 ‚Üí $742k accessible knowledge**
**Medium-Confidence Value: Functional prototype in 3 hours**
**Low-Confidence Value: Production-ready system without testing**

**Bottom Line**: AI development delivers unprecedented leverage of human collective intelligence, enabling individual developers to access and synthesize decades of specialized knowledge in hours rather than years. However, the responsibility for validation, safety, and production readiness remains firmly in human hands.

The true revolution isn't replacing human developers‚Äîit's enabling them to stand on the shoulders of giants with unprecedented ease and speed.
