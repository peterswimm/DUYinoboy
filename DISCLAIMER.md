# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è

## AI-GENERATED CODE WARNING

**THIS ENTIRE PROJECT WAS CREATED BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**

### ü§ñ What This Means:

- **GENERATED**: All code written through AI conversation prompts
- **UNTESTED**: Never run on actual RK-002 or Game Boy hardware  
- **UNVERIFIED**: Not reviewed by electronics or firmware experts
- **EXPERIMENTAL**: May contain bugs, timing issues, or hardware conflicts

### ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS:

- **Hardware Damage**: Incorrect GPIO timing could damage Game Boy
- **Data Loss**: Untested EEPROM code could corrupt settings
- **Compatibility Issues**: May not work with real RK-002 firmware
- **Timing Problems**: MIDI sync may be unreliable or incorrect

### ‚úÖ SAFER ALTERNATIVES:

1. **Use Official Code**: Check [Retrokits examples](https://duy.retrokits.com/)
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Start with simple LED blink tests
3. **Use DUY Web Editor**: Official browser-based development environment
4. **Get Expert Review**: Have electronics experts validate before use

### üõ°Ô∏è IF YOU PROCEED:

- **Start Small**: Test individual functions before full implementation
- **Use Protection**: Consider isolation circuits for vintage hardware
- **Monitor Carefully**: Watch for unusual behavior or heating
- **Have Backups**: Save original firmware and settings
- **Take Responsibility**: You assume all risks of using this code

### üìß SUPPORT:

**WE CANNOT PROVIDE HARDWARE SUPPORT** - This is experimental AI-generated code.
